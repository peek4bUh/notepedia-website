# GNU

**GNU** is a [unix-like](unix-like.md) [Operating System](Operating%20System) that is [Free software](Free%20software). That means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even games. The development of **GNU**, started in January 1984, is known as the [GNU Project](GNU%20Project). Many of the programs in **GNU** are released under the auspices of the [GNU Project](GNU%20Project); those we call [GNU packages](https://www.gnu.org/software/).

The name **GNU** is a recursive acronym for â€œGNU's Not Unix."

The program in a [unix-like](unix-like.md) system that allocates machine resources and talks to the hardware is called the [kernel](kernel). **GNU** is typically used with a kernel called [Linux Philosophy](Linux%20Philosophy). This combination is the [**GNU/Linux operating system**](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html).

GNU's own [kernel](kernel), the [GNU Hurd](GNU%20Hurd), was started in 1990 (before [Linux Philosophy](Linux%20Philosophy) was started).
