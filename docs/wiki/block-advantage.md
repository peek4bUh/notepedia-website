# Block Advantage

**Block advantage** defines the time the defender has to stay on a blockstun, **block advantage** goes two ways, it can either be positive (`+`) which is advantage for the attacker, or it can be negative (`-`) which means advantage to the defender.

- So if P1 string is -10 on block, it means that P1 is vulnerable for 10 frames at the instant his blockstun fades away, in this period of time P2 can input a 9f moves or lower to catch P1 before he has time to recover from this attack. This action is called Punish.
- In MKX, there is a new propriety that allows any character to block on the last negative frame, so startup attacking frames that matches the same number of blockstun won't punish it, so 10f moves won't punish -10f of disadvantage.
