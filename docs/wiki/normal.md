# Normal

A basic attack usually activated by a single button press. In most fighting games, you will have different normals if you are standing on the ground, holding down to [Crouch](crouch.md), or [jumping](jumping) (a normal used while jumping at the opponent is often called a "jump in"), and some characters may have special attacks, called [command normals](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Command Normal "See Term: Command Normal"), if you hold a direction while pressing a button. Some fighting games also have different normals depending on [how close you are standing](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Proximity Normal "See Term: Proximity Normal") to your opponent. Normals aren't nearly as flashy as [special moves](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Special Move "See Term: Special Move"). but they are extremely important, and will often form the backbone of your strategy.
