# Regular Expressions

**Regular expressions** (shortened as **regex** or **regexp**) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as code, log files, spreadsheets, or even documents.

You can think of regular expressions as [wildcard](shell-wildcards.md) on steroids.

There are four major notations:

- [Basic Regular Expression](Basic%20Regular%20Expression.md)
- Fixed Strings
- [POXIX Extended Regular Expressions](POSIX%20Extended%20Regular%20Expressions.md)
- Perl Regular Expression
