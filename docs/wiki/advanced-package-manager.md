# Advanced Package Manager

Debian-based Linux distributions use the `APT` package manager. A package is an archive file containing multiple ".deb" files. The `dpkg` utility is used to install programs from the associated ".deb" file. `APT` makes updating and installing programs easier because many programs have dependencies. When installing a program from a standalone ".deb" file, we may run into dependency issues and need to download and install one or multiple additional packages. `APT` makes this easier and more efficient by packaging together all of the dependencies needed to install a program.

Each Linux distribution uses software repositories that are updated often. When we update a program or install a new one, the system queries these repositories for the desired package. Repositories can be labeled as stable, testing, or unstable. Most Linux distributions utilize the most stable or "main" repository. This can be checked by viewing the contents of the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file. The repository list for Parrot OS is at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list`.

```shell-session
angel99ab@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list

# parrot repository
# this file was automatically generated by parrot-mirror-selector
deb http://htb.deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling main contrib non-free
#deb-src https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling main contrib non-free
deb http://htb.deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling-security main contrib non-free
#deb-src https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling-security main contrib non-free
```

APT uses a database called the APT cache. This is used to provide information about packages installed on our system offline. We can search the APT cache, for example, to find all `Impacket` related packages.

```shell-session
angel99ab@htb[/htb]$ apt-cache search impacket

impacket-scripts - Links to useful impacket scripts examples
polenum - Extracts the password policy from a Windows system
python-pcapy - Python interface to the libpcap packet capture library (Python 2)
python3-impacket - Python3 module to easily build and dissect network protocols
python3-pcapy - Python interface to the libpcap packet capture library (Python 3)
```

We can then view additional information about a package.

```shell-session
angel99ab@htb[/htb]$ apt-cache show impacket-scripts

Package: impacket-scripts
Version: 1.4
Architecture: all
Maintainer: Kali Developers <devel@kali.org>

Filename: pool/main/i/impacket-scripts/impacket-scripts_1.4_all.deb

```

We can also list all installed packages.

```shell-session
angel99ab@htb[/htb]$ apt list --installed

Listing... Done
accountsservice/rolling,now 0.6.55-2 amd64 [installed,automatic]
adapta-gtk-theme/rolling,now 3.95.0.11-1 all [installed]
adduser/rolling,now 3.118 all [installed]
adwaita-icon-theme/rolling,now 3.36.1-2 all [installed,automatic]
aircrack-ng/rolling,now 1:1.6-4 amd64 [installed,automatic]
<SNIP>
```

If we are missing some packages, we can search for it and install it using the following command.

```shell-session
angel99ab@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install impacket-scripts -y
