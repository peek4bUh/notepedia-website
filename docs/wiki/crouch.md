# Crouch

Holding down on the D-pad or the analog stick so your character crouches close to the ground. You have to crouch while [blocking](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Block "See Term: Block") in order to block [low attacks](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Low Attack "See Term: Low Attack"), but you'll get hit by [overhead attacks](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Overhead Attack "See Term: Overhead Attack"). Your [hurtbox](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Hurtbox "See Term: Hurtbox") is also usually a little wider while you're crouching, so sometimes certain combos will work on you that wouldn't if you were standing up.
