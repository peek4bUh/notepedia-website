# alias

The `alias` command allows you to create replacements for other commands and make them easier to remember and use.

It is mainly used for:

- Abbreviating a system command.
- For adding default arguments to a regularly used command.

**Aliases** expire with the current shell session unless defined in the shell's configuration file, e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`.
