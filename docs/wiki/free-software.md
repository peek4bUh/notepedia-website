# Free Software

**Free software**, **libre software** or **libreware** is computer Operating Systems that respects users freedom and community. Allow _the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software_. **Free software** is a matter of liberty, not price; all users are legally free to do what they want with their copies of a **free software** (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program. Computer programs are deemed "free" if they give end-users (not just the developer) ultimate control over the software and, subsequently, over their devices.

The right to study and modify a computer program entails that the source code the preferred format for making change be made available to users of that program.

**Free software** is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.

You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.

## The four essential freedoms

A program is **free software** if the users of the program have the four essential freedoms:

0. Run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
1. Study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
2. Redistribute copies so you can help others.
3. Distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

> [!note]
> The reason they are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3 is historical. Around 1990 there were three freedoms, numbered 1, 2 and 3. Then we realized that the freedom to run the program needed to be mentioned explicitly. It was clearly more basic than the other three, so it properly should precede them. Rather than renumber the others, we made it freedom 0.
