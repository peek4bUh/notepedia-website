# Stream

A **stream** is a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") of [data elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element "Data element") made available over time. A stream can be thought of as items on a [conveyor belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt "Conveyor belt") being processed one at a time rather than in large batches.
