# Filenames

On Linux systems, files are named in a manner similar to that of the other systems such as Windows, but there are some important differences.

- Filenames that begin with a period (`.`) character are hidden. When your account was created, several hidden files were placed in your home directory to configure things for your account. In addition, some applications place their configuration and settings files in your home directory as hidden files.
- Filenames and commands in Linux, like Unix, are case sensitive. The filenames `File1` and `file1` refer to different files.
- Linux supports long filenames that filenames that may contain contain embedded spaces and punctuation characters, limit the punctuation characters in the names of files you created to `.` (period), `-` (dash) and `_` (underscore) characters. You will thank yourself later.
- Linux has no concept of a "file extension" like some other operating systems. You may name files any way you like. The contents or purpose of a file is determined by other means. Although Unix-like operating systems don't use file extensions to determine the contents/purpose of files, many applications programs do.
