# Virtual Private Network

A **virtual private network** (**VPN**) is a network architecture that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device (computer, laptop, phone, etc.) and a remote server. This connection acts like a "tunnel," allowing your internet traffic to pass through it securely before reaching the wider internet.

Using a VPN improves privacy, security, and freedom when you're online by creating a protected, private network on top of the public internet.

Virtual private networks configurations can be classified depending on the purpose you wanna achieve:

- Remote Access VPN
- [Site-To-Site VPN](site-to-site-vpn.md)
- SSL VPN
