# Command Prompt

A **command prompt** or **prompt** is a sequence of one or more characters used in a [command-line Interface](command-line-interface.md) to indicate that it is ready to accept commands.

A prompt usually ends with one of the characters `$`, `%`, `#`, `:`, `>` or `-` and often includes other information, such as the path of the current working directory and the hostname.

On many [Unix](Unix) and [unix-like](unix-like.md) systems, the prompt commonly ends in `$` or `%` if is a normal user or in `#` if is a superuser (e.g., root).

Depending on the environment, you can use colors, special characters, and other elements such as the user, hostname, working directory, etc., to make the prompt more informative or more beautiful.
