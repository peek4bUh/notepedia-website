# Virtual Console

A **virtual console** or **virtual terminal** is a feature of some Unix-like operating systems in which the system console of the computer can be used to switch between multiple virtual consoles to access unrelated user interfaces.

If you don't have a [terminal emulator](terminal-emulator.md) running, several terminal sessions continue to run behind the graphical desktop. You can access these sessions called **virtual consoles**, by pressing `CTRL-ALT-F1` through `CTRL-ALT-F6` on most Linux distributions.

When a session is accessed, it presents a login prompt into which you can enter your username and password.

On most systems, you can return to the graphical desktop by pressing `ALT-F7`.
