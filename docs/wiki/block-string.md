# Block String

A **block string** is a series of multiple attacks

> A **block string** is a series of attacks that is [blocked](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Block/Guard) by a defending player. A block string may be understood to be a [combo string](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#String) that is blocked, wherein the defending player tries to block every hit of the string, and the attacking player tries to land a hit through the block and subsequently [hit-confirm](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Hit_Confirm) into a combo. Block strings give the attacking player multiple opportunities to apply [mix-ups](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Mix-Up), and are essential to applying [pressure](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Pressure).

> If a block string has no gaps where the opponent recovers from [block stun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Block_Stun), it is a "true block string," and the opponent cannot act unless they utilize a special system mechanic that may be present in the game, such as a [guard cancel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Guard_Cancel) or [pushblock](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Push_Block). It is often desirable to also use block strings that _do_ contain gaps, since gaps can create opportunities for other [mind games](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Mind_Games) (i.e. [frame traps](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Frame_Trap), [tick throws](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_fighting_games#Throw)).

> A series of multiple attacks that work well against a [blocking](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Block "See Term: Block") opponent. Generally, a block string will be composed of several [plus on block](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Plus "See Term: Plus") or [cancelable](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Cancel "See Term: Cancel") attacks performed in quick sequence. When blocked, these will slowly push your character out of [range](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Range "See Term: Range") and prevent the opponent from counter-attacking, which makes them a very good default, low-risk option when trying to apply [offense](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Offense "See Term: Offense"). Good block strings may even let you [hit confirm](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Hit Confirm "See Term: Hit Confirm") into more damage if the opponent flinches and stops blocking!

> Some people think a block string must leave no [gaps](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Gap "See Term: Gap"); that is to say, you will be able to keep attacking your opponent trapped in [block stun](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Block Stun "See Term: Block Stun") with multiple attacks until you get pushed too far away. Not everyone uses the term in this way, though â€” some people are okay using the term even if there are small gaps between some attacks that might [frame trap](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Frame Trap "See Term: Frame Trap") your opponent, as long as the gap isn't very big. Because of this, you might hear "true block string" used to refer to a block string that has no gaps, to avoid confusion.
