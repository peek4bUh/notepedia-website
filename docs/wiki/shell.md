# Shell

A **shell** is simply a [Macro Processor](macro-processor.md) that executes commands.

You can think of a **shell** as a text-based GUI in which you enter commands to perform actions like navigating to other directories, working with files, and obtaining information from the system but with way more capabilities.

Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.
