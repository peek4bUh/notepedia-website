# Linux Philosophy

Linux follows five core principles:

| **Principle**                                                                              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                |

| <span class="highlight">Everything is a file</span>                                        | All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.                                   |
| <span class="highlight">Small, single-purpose programs</span>                              | Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.                                                              |
| <span class="highlight">Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks</span> | The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results. |
| <span class="highlight">Avoid captive user interfaces</span>                               | Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.                                 |
| <span class="highlight">Configuration data stored in a text file</span>                    | An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores all users registered on the system.                                                          |
