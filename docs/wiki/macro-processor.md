# Macro Processor

A **macro processor** is a program that copies a [Stream](stream.md) of text from one place to another, making a systematic set of replacements as it does so. **Macro processors** are often embedded in other programs, such as assemblers and compilers. Sometimes they are standalone programs that can be used to process any kind of text.

**Macro processors** have been used for language expansion (defining new language constructs that can be expressed in terms of existing language components), for systematic text replacements that require decision making, and for text reformatting (e.g. conditional extraction of material from an HTML file.

The term **macro processor** means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.
