# Terminal Emulator

When using a [GUI](GUI), you need another program called a **terminal emulator** to interact with the [shell](shell.md).

For example in each desktop environment like KDE uses konsole, GNOME uses gnome-terminal, XFCE uses xfce4-terminal, though it's likely called simply Terminal. A number of other terminal emulators are available for Linux, but they all basically do the same thing: give us access to the [shell](shell.md).

You can end a terminal session by closing the terminal emulator window, by entering the `exit` command, or by pressing `CTRL-D`.
