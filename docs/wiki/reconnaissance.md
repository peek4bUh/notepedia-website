# Reconnaissance

**Reconnaissance** (or **recon**) phase, also known as **footprinting** is the process of acquiring information about a target. That target might be a computer, a network, or a future victim of a social engineering attack.

Reconnaissance can be one of the following, depending on how to gather the information:

- [Active Reconnaissance](active-reconnaissance.md)
- [Passive Reconnaissance](passive-reconnaissance.md)
