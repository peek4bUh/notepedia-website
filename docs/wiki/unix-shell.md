# Unix Shell

A **Unix shell** is a [command-line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter "Command-line interface") or [shell](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)> "Shell (computing)") that provides a command line [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") for [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). The shell is both an interactive [command language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_language "Command language") and a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language "Scripting language"), and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script)

A Unix shell is both a [command interpreter](command%20interpreter) and a [programming language](programming%20language). As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. Files containing commands can be created, and become commands themselves. These new commands have the same status as system commands in directories such as /bin, allowing users or groups to establish custom environments to automate their common tasks.
